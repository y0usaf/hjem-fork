## Sanity Checking

Please check all that apply. As before, this section is not a hard requirement but checklists with more checked
items are likely to be merged faster. You may save some time in maintainer reviews by performing self-reviews
here before submitting your pull request.

If your pull request includes any change or unexpected behaviour not covered below, please do make sure to include
it above in your description.

<!--
If your changes touch upon a portion of the codebase that you do not understand well, please make sure to consult
the maintainers on your changes. In most cases, making an issue before creating your PR will help you avoid duplicate
efforts in the long run. `git blame` might help you find out who is the "author" or the "maintainer" of a current
module by showing who worked on it the most.
